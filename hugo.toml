ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **Making of a Maker** blog!

-

- May name is James. I'm a 33 year old guy learning to build with modern low-code development tools.

- 

- I am **not** a software developer by background. I spent the last 10 years working in finance, but for a long time have had a niggling feeling I would like to do something more creative.

- 

- I have spent longer than I care like to admit lurking on forums like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) or reading through online business success stories on [Medium](https://medium.com/).

- 

- I recently quit my job. So whilst I look for another, I am building skills to launch my own side project. (Details to be worked out!)

- 

- Here is where I will share my progress.

- 

- If you are a novice like me, who until now has been lurking on the forums, **subscribe below**. I'd love to be in touch with other apiring Makers.
