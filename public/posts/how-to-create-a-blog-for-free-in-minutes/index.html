Instant publishing platforms like Wordpress seemed too inflexible, so I looked towards other static site generators.\nI settled on using Hugo and am happy with the result. Within just a few steps, I published my blog for free on GitHub Pages.\nTo save you time piecing together the different sources of documentation. Here is the process laid out in full, with additional commentary on things I wish I knew when setting it up myself.\nAs a bonus at the end, I’ll show you how to point a custom domain to the blog.\nDisclaimer: you need to buy a domain for this part 💸. It’s not essential, but it makes your blog look more professional.\nCreate a personal blog in minutes Pre-requisites Getting started requires that you have basic familiarity with the command line and have git (version control) installed. This might sounds scary, but I promise it’s easier that you think!\nYou will also need access to a code editor (I recommend VS Code). So if you need to need to get up to speed, here are some useful links.\nGetting started with VS Code\nCommand line for beginners\nInstructions for installing git\nInstall Hugo Now, let’s get started. First, follow the Hugo installation instructions for your platform. For macOS, I use Homebrew from the command line.\nbrew install hugo Pick your theme Next the fun part! Look through these Hugo themes and pick one that you like for your blog. I went with the PaperMod theme.\nThere will be installation instructions specific to your chosen theme on its dedicated page.\nHowever, in general, for the next step you just need a link to your theme’s GitHub repositiory. It should look something like this:\nhttps://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod Important: Where I use the link above and references to ‘PaperMod’ in the code below, modify to your chosen theme as appropriate.\nCreate a blog You’re ready to create your blog. Using the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store your blog.\nThen run the two commands below on the command line. These will create a new directory titled YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME and move you into that directory.\nhugo new site YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME cd YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME Next up, these commands initialise git version control and download your chosen theme into your blog directory (remember to use your theme’s URL).\ngit init git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod Now add your chosen theme to your hugo.toml (your blog’s main configuration file.)\necho \"theme = 'PaperMod'\" \u003e\u003e hugo.toml If everything is set up correctly, hugo server should launch a local version of your blog.\nhugo server You should see something like this in the terminal:\nWeb Server is available at http://localhost:62168/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Use the localhost address in the browser to view your new blog.\nCustomise the landing page Your template is up and running. Now let’s customise the landing page.\nOpen your blog directory up in your favourite code editor. If you are using VS Code, the command is:\ncode PATH/TO/YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME The folder directory should look something like this:\n. ├── archetypes ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── hugo.toml ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── public ├── static └── themes Open up the hugo.toml file and add this to the bottom:\n[params.homeInfoParams] Title = \"Welcome\" Content = \"\"\" 👋 Welcome to MY PERSONAL blog! \"\"\" Now save the file and refresh your browser. You should see the changes on the page.\nAdd your first post The landing page is set. Now to add our first blog post.\nhugo new content posts/YOUR-FIRST-POST.md This will create a markdown file in the content/posts/ directory of your project that looks like this:\n+++ title = 'YOUR FIRST POST' date = 2024-04-26T18:43:42+01:00 draft = false +++ Go ahead and add some content to your post below the front matter. The post is in draft mode, so to preview, you’ll need to use the --buildDrafts or -D flag when running.\nhugo server -D Further customisation Detailed instructions on further customisation is beyond the scope of this article. Just know that Hugo is very flexible!\nIf you want to make further changes, do not make them directly in the theme directory. Instead, familiarise yourself with the template lookup order and define teamplates that override bits of the theme you would like to change.\nPublish to GitHub Pages The blog works nicely on your local machine. But how do you publish it on the internet so other people can see it too?\nGitHub Pages is certainly one of the easiest ways. And it’s the method we’ll use below.\nSet up your GitHub repo To deploy a website you need to move your local code into a GitHub repository. There are multiple ways to do this. Use the link to determine the option that suits you best. I like to use the GitHub command line interface.\nbrew install gh # if you don't have the GitHub CLI installed. gh repo create hen follow the in line instructions. Then follow the in line instructions.\nConfigure GitHub actions Once your GitHub repo is created, you need to configure GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your website each time you push updated code to the repo.\nFollow the instructions provided in the Hugo documentation for deploying to GitHub pages. These instructions will guide you through:\nSetting the GitHub Pages build and deployment source to GitHub actions. Adding a hugo.yaml file to a .github/workflows folder in your project directory. Push your site to GitHub Finally, add your changes to git and push a commit to your github repo.\ngit add . git commit -m 'Deploy blog with GitHub Actions' git push --set-upstream origin main That’s it! Wait a minute or so for the GitHub Actions to run. Then navigate back to the Github Pages settings find a URL for your newly deployed and publically available blog 🎉.\nView the site in your browser.\nBONUS Add your own domain After you have settled down from the pure joy and excitement of finally publishing something FOR REAL on the internet (👊🏼), your next thought will likely be about your domain name.\nCheck the browser address bar and your blog’s URl will look something like:\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME/ Hmm. Not very professional…\nHere’s how to add your own domain name.\nBuy your domain Go to your favourite domain name registry and purchase a domain. There are plenty to choose from. I use GoDaddy, so will show screenshots of their interface below.\nConfigure DNS settings Once you have purchased your domain, log in to your GoDaddy account and navigate to the DNS records section of the domain.\nHere you should configure your DNS records to point to your newly created blog hosted by GitHub Pages.\nMy account looks like this:\nImportant: these changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate through the internet. However, often it happens much quicker.\nAdd Custom Domain to GitHub Whilst you wait, add your new domain to the top or your hugo.toml file of your project directory.\nbaseURL = 'https://YOUR-NEW-DOMAIN.com' Push your changes to GitHub.\ngit add . git commit -m 'Add domain name to config' Finally, within your GitHub repo, navigate back to the GitHub Pages section of the ‘Settings’ tab and enter your new domain in the space provided.\nThis will verify that you have set up your DNS records correctly.\nOnce the DNS changes have fully propogated (remember, be patient!) you will be able to access your blog at your own custom domain. Wahoo! 🎉\nYou did it! Now, go forth and start blogging.\nOne more thing! If you found this useful, please burn a few finger calories by clapping this post 👏🏻. It helps me know whether I am writing things that you find useful.\nAlso, consider subscribing to my blog over at Making of a Maker. I’m learning low-code development to build a cash generating side project.\nI am just getting started and intend to share my progress. I’d also love to be in touch with other makers. Until next time, thanks all! 🙏🏻\n",

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get started. First, follow the <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">Hugo installation instructions</a> for your platform. For macOS, I use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> from the command line.</p>
<pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre>
<h4 id="pick-your-theme">Pick your theme<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pick-your-theme">#</a></h4>
<p>Next the fun part! Look through these <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes</a> and pick one that you like for your blog. I went with the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/">PaperMod</a> theme.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/hugo-themes.png" alt="Hugo themes"  />
</p>
<p>There will be installation instructions specific to your chosen theme on its dedicated page.</p>
<p>However, in general, for the next step you just need a link to your theme&rsquo;s GitHub repositiory. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Where I use the link above and references to &lsquo;PaperMod&rsquo; in the code below, modify to your chosen theme as appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="create-a-blog">Create a blog<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-a-blog">#</a></h4>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready to create your blog. Using the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store your blog.</p>
<p>Then run the two commands below on the command line. These will create a new directory titled <code>YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME</code> and move you into that directory.</p>
<pre><code>hugo new site YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME
cd YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME
</code></pre>
<p>Next up, these commands initialise git version control and download your chosen theme into your blog directory (remember to use your theme&rsquo;s URL).</p>
<pre><code>git init
git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
</code></pre>
<p>Now add your chosen theme to your hugo.toml (your blog&rsquo;s main configuration file.)</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;theme = 'PaperMod'&quot; &gt;&gt; hugo.toml
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is set up correctly, <code>hugo server</code> should launch a local version of your blog.</p>
<pre><code>hugo server
</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like this in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>Web Server is available at http://localhost:62168/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>Use the localhost address in the browser to view your new blog.</p>

</p>
<h4 id="customise-the-landing-page">Customise the landing page<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customise-the-landing-page">#</a></h4>
<p>Your template is up and running. Now let&rsquo;s customise the landing page.</p>
<p>Open your blog directory up in your favourite code editor. If you are using VS Code, the command is:</p>
<pre><code>code PATH/TO/YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME
</code></pre>
<p>The folder directory should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── archetypes
├── assets
├── content
├── data
├── hugo.toml
├── i18n
├── layouts
├── public
├── static
└── themes
</code></pre>
<p>Open up the <code>hugo.toml</code> file and add this to the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>[params.homeInfoParams]
Title = &quot;Welcome&quot;
Content = &quot;&quot;&quot;
👋 Welcome to MY PERSONAL blog!
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now save the file and refresh your browser. You should see the changes on the page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/blog-home-page.png" alt="Blog home page"  />
</p>
<h4 id="add-your-first-post">Add your first post<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#add-your-first-post">#</a></h4>
<p>The landing page is set. Now to add our first blog post.</p>
<pre><code>hugo new content posts/YOUR-FIRST-POST.md
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a markdown file in the <code>content/posts/</code> directory of your project that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>+++
title = 'YOUR FIRST POST'
date = 2024-04-26T18:43:42+01:00
draft = false
+++
</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and add some content to your post below the front matter. The post is in draft mode, so to preview, you&rsquo;ll need to use the <code>--buildDrafts</code> or <code>-D</code> flag when running.</p>
<pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre>

<h4 id="further-customisation">Further customisation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#further-customisation">#</a></h4>
<p>Detailed instructions on further customisation is beyond the scope of this article. Just know that Hugo is very flexible!</p>
<p>If you want to make further changes, <strong>do not</strong> make them directly in the theme directory. Instead, familiarise yourself with the <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/">template lookup order</a> and define teamplates that override bits of the theme you would like to change.</p>
<h2 id="publish-to-github-pages">Publish to GitHub Pages<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#publish-to-github-pages">#</a></h2>
<p>The blog works nicely on your local machine. But how do you publish it on the internet so other people can see it too?</p>
<p>GitHub Pages is certainly one of the easiest ways. And it&rsquo;s the method we&rsquo;ll use below.</p>
<h4 id="set-up-your-github-repo">Set up your GitHub repo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#set-up-your-github-repo">#</a></h4>
<p>To deploy a website you need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github">move your local code into a GitHub repository</a>. There are multiple ways to do this. Use the link to determine the option that suits you best. I like to use the GitHub command line interface.</p>
<pre><code>brew install gh # if you don't have the GitHub CLI installed.
gh repo create hen follow the in line instructions.
</code></pre>
<p>Then follow the in line instructions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/create-github-repo.png" alt="Create github repo"  />
</p>
<h4 id="configure-github-actions">Configure GitHub actions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#configure-github-actions">#</a></h4>
<p>Once your GitHub repo is created, you need to configure GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your website each time you push updated code to the repo.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions provided in the <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Hugo documentation for deploying to GitHub pages</a>. These instructions will guide you through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting the GitHub Pages build and deployment source to GitHub actions.</li>
<li>Adding a <code>hugo.yaml</code> file to a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder in your project directory.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="push-your-site-to-github">Push your site to GitHub<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#push-your-site-to-github">#</a></h4>
<p>Finally, add your changes to git and push a commit to your github repo.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m 'Deploy blog with GitHub Actions'
git push --set-upstream origin main
</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Wait a minute or so for the GitHub Actions to run. Then navigate back to the Github Pages settings find a URL for your newly deployed and <strong>publically available</strong> blog 🎉.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/github-pages.png" alt="GitHub pages deployed site"  />
</p>
<p>View the site in your browser.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/blog-with-post.png" alt="Blog with post"  />
</p>
<h2 id="bonus-add-your-own-domain">BONUS Add your own domain<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bonus-add-your-own-domain">#</a></h2>
<p>After you have settled down from the pure joy and excitement of finally publishing something FOR REAL on the internet (👊🏼), your next thought will likely be about your domain name.</p>
<p>Check the browser address bar and your blog&rsquo;s URl will look something like:</p>
<pre><code>https://USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-BLOG-DIRECTORY-NAME/
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Not very professional&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to add your own domain name.</p>
<h4 id="buy-your-domain">Buy your domain<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#buy-your-domain">#</a></h4>
<p>Go to your favourite domain name registry and purchase a domain. There are plenty to choose from. I use <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk">GoDaddy</a>, so will show screenshots of their interface below.</p>
<h4 id="configure-dns-settings">Configure DNS settings<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#configure-dns-settings">#</a></h4>
<p>Once you have purchased your domain, log in to your GoDaddy account and navigate to the DNS records section of the domain.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/dns-config.png" alt="Go Daddy DNS"  />
</p>
<p>Here you should <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#dns-records-for-your-custom-domain">configure your DNS records</a> to point to your newly created blog hosted by GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>My account looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/dns-records.png" alt="DNS Record Configuration"  />
</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: these changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate through the internet. However, often it happens much quicker.</p>
<h4 id="add-custom-domain-to-github">Add Custom Domain to GitHub<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#add-custom-domain-to-github">#</a></h4>
<p>Whilst you wait, add your new domain to the top or your <code>hugo.toml</code> file of your project directory.</p>
<pre><code>baseURL = 'https://YOUR-NEW-DOMAIN.com'
</code></pre>
<p>Push your changes to GitHub.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m 'Add domain name to config'
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, within your GitHub repo, navigate back to the GitHub Pages section of the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; tab and enter your new domain in the space provided.</p>
<p>This will verify that you have set up your DNS records correctly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/add-domain.png" alt="Add custom domain field"  />
</p>
<p>Once the DNS changes have fully propogated (remember, be patient!) you will be able to access your blog at your own custom domain. Wahoo! 🎉</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/final-blog.png" alt="Final blog"  />
</p>
<p>You did it! Now, go forth and start blogging.</p>
